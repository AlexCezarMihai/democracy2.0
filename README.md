# Democracy 2.0

For the past month I’ve been thinking about how the world could be better. I have found a solution and I am working on a project that could benefit all of us.

The current electoral system is 800 years old. We elect members of parliament and we trust that they will vote on laws the way we would like them to. It made sense 800 years ago; however, we live in a digital age, an age where it should be possible for each voter to express their opinion on upcoming laws so that our elected members of parliament know how their constituents want them to vote. 

I will build a website that allows voters to give their opinion on upcoming laws. Our elected MPs can gauge the way the voters in their constituency want them to vote. In the first iteration, it will be a website where voters can log in and see the upcoming laws and vote on them. There will be a public page where anyone, including the members of parliament, can see the will of the people.

I don’t want us to change the current law generation procedure. I want to add an optional direct representation component to our current political system. Our elected MPs could still vote as they wish, as they do today; however they should be able to see how their constituents want to be represented in parliament. We elect MPs to represent our interests and I believe they should be able to know how we want them to vote.

In its most  basic form, the minimally viable product (MVP) is a website that allows a citizen to see upcoming federal laws, and anonymously vote the way they would like their MP to vote. Also there will be a public page for each electoral district where anybody can see what the public opinion is on a certain upcoming law.

Right now I am searching for like minded volunteers that want to help revise democracy. We live in a time when it’s a shame that we don’t have the tools to express  our desires concerning our future even though technology exists. We need contributors with skills in a wide variety of fields.

In order to be fully transparent, all the code for this project will be public. 

After the MVP is done, we will need to spread the word, use it and assess its usefulness.  Furthermore we should use this tool for the provincial governments. There are many additional features that could be integrated once we know the project gains traction.

Feel free to contact me if you want to contribute and feel free to express your opinion about the project. If you think more people should hear about this, share it!
